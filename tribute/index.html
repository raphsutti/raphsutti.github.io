    <blockquote>
      <p>During the early days of Apollo, software was treated like a stepchild; it was not taken as seriously as other engineering disciplines. ... Having this kind of responsibility resulted in our creating a “field”, since there was no school at the time to learn “software engineering". This necessitated our creating methods, standards, rules and tools for developing the flight software</p>
